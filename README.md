# Personalized-Real-Estate-Agent_Home-Match
This project builds an Agent for real estate recommandation. I use the OpenAI API to generate the initial estate listings and then match the right estate to user preferences by vector dataBases. Besides, i also leverage an LLM to customize a more refined desciption, highlighting estate's features that the users care about most. Via LangChain framework, i simplify the implementation.
